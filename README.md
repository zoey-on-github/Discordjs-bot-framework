# Discordjs-bot-framework

A basic sample bot for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).\
Provides everything you need to get started, except a config.json, as it requires your bot and guild ids. 

# Prerequistes  

Obviously you'll need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), discord js(`node install discord.js`), discord js builders (`npm install @discordjs/builders`), and api-types(`npm install discord-api-types`) you'll also need to give your own config.json and process.env files(if you don't know what I mean by this, check the [discord.js guide](https://discord.js.guide)) and that's pretty much it
